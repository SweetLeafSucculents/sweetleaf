story: "One of the easiest pitcher plants to grow. Plants come potted in a 3.5 inch square plastic pot with pure long fiber sphagnum moss, so it is ready to go and doesn't need to be repotted in a different medium. These would be considered large starters are their leaves span between 9 inches and 12 inches at the largest point. Plants have an average of five or six pitchers."

One of the easiest pitcher plants to grow. Plants come potted in a 3.5 inch square plastic pot with pure long fiber sphagnum moss, so it is ready to go and doesn't need to be repotted in a different medium. These would be considered large starters are their leaves span between 9" and 12" at the largest point. Plants have an average of five or six pitchers.

<strong>Care:</strong> These plants will not need to be repotted for several month after arrival. When repotting, plant in pure long fiber sphagnum moss or long fiber moss and perlite (50/50 ratio). These plants like a growing medium without fertilizers or nutrients and get what they need from the bugs in their pitchers.

Mist twice a day and keep moss moist at all times but not sitting in water. Water and mist with rainwater, reverse osmosis water or distilled. DO not feed meat, such as ground beef. Allow plants to eat bugs that they catch on their own, or give them a fresh insect once a month or so when large enough. When left outside they will typically catch everything they need. When removing dead pitchers, cut off at the tendril and allow the leaf to stay until it dies.



## Care Instructions

<strong>When the plant arrives</strong>, carefully pull the bag out of the box, and cut the nepenthes out of the bag to prevent damage to pitchers. Carefully remove paper that is tucked in between the leaves of the plants, and untangle the pitchers by following the stem on the pitcher to the leaf to figure out the best way to untangle them without tearing the pitchers off. Replace any moss that has fallen out of the pot. Water ONLY with distilled water (but NO other types of bottled water), reverse osmosis water or clean, collected rain. NO TAP WATER! Tap water contains dissolved minerals that will slowly kill your plant. Neps can tolerate tap much better than other CPs, so if you are in a pinch and that is your only option, flush well with appropriate water to get any dissolved solids that have built up in the growing medium out. After cutting out of the bag and removing paper, water thoroughly until water runs out of the holes in the bottom. When not flushing, you can also catch the water that runs out and use it again the next time you water, but don’t let the plant just sit in a tray of water so the roots don’t rot. 

We want you to be successful at keeping your plants happy and healthy. If you have any questions about their care, please do not hesitate to contact us! We are happy to help! Even if it has been weeks or months since you bought your plant. If we can help, we are happy to!

Your nepenthes is coming from a carnivorous plant grower and not a big box store. It has never been given tap water. There is no need to flush or repot on arrival. Your plant is growing in the correct medium and can remain in this pot until you feel that it is ready to be moved to a larger pot. When this time comes, gently wrap the roots in pure long fiber sphagnum moss or a 50/50 mixture of long fiber sphagnum moss and perlite. 

Keep the moss in the plant pot moist and damp at all times. Do not allow your plant to dry out and always water with the appropriate type of water (see above). Do not allow your plants to sit in a dish of water or on a saucer with water in it. Allow your plant to drain free so that the roots do not sit in water and rot. 

Lowland nepenthes are tropical plants and love humidity. Mist your plant twice a day with the appropriate water, especially keeping pitchers moist, as allowing them to dry out will speed their death. But never fear! Every new leaf has the potential to produce a new pitcher. Misting pitchers as they are developing will help them to grow bigger. 

Your nepenthes will produce its own liquid for the pitchers. This liquid is slightly acidic & helps dissolve bugs so the plant can absorb them. If your pitchers are dry you can add the appropriate water to the pitcher, but don’t fill pitchers more than a third full. Filling more than this will not only dilute the solution that the plant makes, but it will also make it possible for the bugs to climb back out. Pitchers have lids to keep rain out, but if temps are high and the pitchers cannot keep up with evaporation, it is better to add the appropriate water, as dry pitchers will speed the death of the pitchers. 

From time to time (including during transit) pitchers will die. They typically start with the lid drying up and then dry from the top to the bottom. We suggest leaving the pitchers on the plant until they are completely dry, so that the plant can absorb as much nutrients as possible. Once the pitcher has dried, you can remove the pitcher (at the tip of the leaf), or leave them hanging there. The choice is entirely yours and has no impact on the plant itself. Merely cosmetic at that point. Pitchers will typically last between 2 - 6 months. When leaves dry up and die, simply trim them off when they have completely died all the way to the vine. Any live leaf that is left is still photosynthesizing and the plant uses the nutrients in the leaf until it is all dried up. Then simply snip off at the base of the vine.

Finally, do not feed these plants with human food, such as ham or ground beef. If left outside, they will catch everything they need on their own, but while inside if your plant does not have access to any bugs, simply place a fresh bug in a pitcher every month or so. If the bug is still alive, make sure that it lands in the water to help prevent it from climbing back out. The rim of the pitchers is sticky, because it produces a sweet liquid that will draw bugs closer. They stop to eat the substance and fall into the slippery pitchers and can’t get back out once they hit the liquid inside and their wings get wet. During the Winter time, if there are no bugs in your house, you can drop a couple betta pellets (yes, fish food) into two or three pitchers once a month, but be careful not to over feed. Overly fed pitcher plants will drop their pitchers so that they don’t get anymore to eat. They grow in areas with little to no nutrients, and evolved over hundreds of years to be able to get their nutrients from bugs and they don’t need much food to survive.
